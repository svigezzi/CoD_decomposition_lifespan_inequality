Here you can find the scripts and (if necessary) data to reproduce the results of the paper "Cause-of-death determinants of lifespan inequality", by IÃ±aki Permanyer and Serena Vigezzi.

You need only run the script "Master.R", which already has the scripts to run in order. To this script, you need to add your HMD username and password.
By default, this script attempts to download the data directly from the websites (Human Mortality Database data from https://mortality.org/ and WHO cause-of-death data from https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/who-mortality-database
If you don't have an Internet connection or if the data has been updated in a way that changes results, you can also use the the datasets provided in the "Data" folder.
This will give you the datasets already cleand and formatted to be used for the calculations. At 08/06/2023, the data reproduce the results.
